# Rocket-Elevator-Mobile

Week 16 Mobile app 

This week i built a mobile app to have information and make change about the elevator with three page,
the first one is the welcome page,ou just have to put an employee email and press the login button to go to the next page.
The second page is the home page, there you have the list of all the elevator that the status is Offline or Intervention.
You can scroll trough them and pick an elevator, just press on it. It will go to the last page. The last page is the status page,
there you have all the info about the selected elevator. If you press the End Task button a the bottom of the page it will change 
the status to Online, you'll receive the confirmation alert. The status will now be green and the End Task Button is now a return button to
go back to the home page with the list of elevator.

Thank You -Anthony
